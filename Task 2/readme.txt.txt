O1 Optimization:

Takes longer route with more detailed steps
Starts at memory address 0x10184
More instructions and steps visible
Easier to debug and follow the program flow
Good for development and testing phase

Ofast Optimization:

Takes shorter, faster route
Starts at memory address 0x100b0
Fewer instructions to do the same task
Harder to debug but better performance
Perfect for final production code

Main Differences:

Memory addresses are organized differently
Ofast uses fewer registers more efficiently
Instruction count is lower in Ofast
Both reach same result (120) but through different paths

Memory & Performance:

Ofast has more compact code layout
Better register management in Ofast
Less memory usage in Ofast version
Faster execution due to optimization

Trade-offs:

O1: Better debugging vs slower performance
Ofast: Better performance vs harder debugging
O1 shows clear instruction flow
Ofast focuses on speed over readability
