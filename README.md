## Task 1 - Compilation Differences Between -O1 and -Ofast

### -O1 Optimization
- Prioritizes readable and understandable code with basic optimizations.
- Larger number of instructions due to minimal optimization.
- Keeps intermediate calculations and variables in memory.
- Detailed code flow makes it easier to follow and debug.

### -Ofast Optimization
- Aggressive optimization for maximum performance, potentially sacrificing strict adherence to standards.
- Fewer instructions as redundant operations are removed.
- More compact code layout with streamlined computations.
- Reduced intermediate steps, making the code harder to debug but faster to execute.

## Task 2 - Optimization Flags -O1 and -Ofast Performance

### -O1 Optimization
- Takes longer route with more detailed steps.  
- Starts at memory address `0x10184`.  
- More instructions and steps visible.  
- Easier to debug and follow the program flow.  
- Good for development and testing phase.  

### -Ofast Optimization
- Takes shorter, faster route.  
- Starts at memory address `0x100b0`.  
- Fewer instructions to do the same task.  
- Harder to debug but better performance.  
- Perfect for final production code.  

### Main Differences
- Memory addresses are organized differently.  
- `-Ofast` uses fewer registers more efficiently.  
- Instruction count is lower in `-Ofast`.  
- Both reach the same result (e.g., 120) but through different paths.  

### Memory & Performance
- `-Ofast` has a more compact code layout.  
- Better register management in `-Ofast`.  
- Less memory usage in the `-Ofast` version.  
- Faster execution due to optimization.  

### Trade-offs
- **O1**: Better debugging vs slower performance.  
- **Ofast**: Better performance vs harder debugging.  
- `-O1` shows a clear instruction flow.  
- `-Ofast` focuses on speed over readability.
